# Using Reranker Models

**Reranker Models** are specialized models designed to improve the ranking of a list of items based on relevance to a given query. They are commonly used in information retrieval and search systems to refine initial search results, prioritizing items that are more likely to meet the userâ€™s intent. Reranker models take the initial document list and reorder items to enhance precision in applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering tasks.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to deploy and use reranker models in GPUStack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- GPUStack is installed and running. If not, refer to the [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart.md).
- Access to Hugging Face for downloading the model files.

## Step 1: Deploy the Model

Follow these steps to deploy the model from Hugging Face:

1. Navigate to the `Models` page in the GPUStack UI.
2. Click the `Deploy Model` button.
3. In the dropdown, select `Hugging Face` as the source for your model.
4. Enable the `GGUF` checkbox to filter models by GGUF format.
5. Use the search bar in the top left to search for the model name `gpustack/bge-reranker-v2-m3-GGUF`.
6. Leave everything as default and click the `Save` button to deploy the model.

After deployment, you can monitor the model's status on the `Models` page.

## Step 2: Generate an API Key

We will use the GPUStack API to interact with the model. To do this, you need to generate an API key:

1. Navigate to the `API Keys` page in the GPUStack UI.
2. Click the `New API Key` button.
3. Enter a name for the API key and click the `Save` button.
4. Copy the generated API key. You can only view the API key once, so make sure to save it securely.

## Step 3: Reranking

With the model deployed and an API key, you can rerank a list of documents via the GPUStack API. Here is an example script using `curl`:

```bash
export SERVER_URL=<your-server-url>
export GPUSTACK_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
curl $SERVER_URL/v1/rerank \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GPUSTACK_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "bge-reranker-v2-m3",
        "query": "What is a panda?",
        "top_n": 3,
        "documents": [
            "hi",
            "it is a bear",
            "The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China."
        ]
    }' | jq
```

Replace `<your-server-url>` with the URL of your GPUStack server and `<your-api-key>` with the API key you generated in the previous step.

Example response:

```json
{
  "model": "bge-reranker-v2-m3",
  "object": "list",
  "results": [
    {
      "document": {
        "text": "The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China."
      },
      "index": 2,
      "relevance_score": 1.951932668685913
    },
    {
      "document": {
        "text": "it is a bear"
      },
      "index": 1,
      "relevance_score": -3.7347371578216553
    },
    {
      "document": {
        "text": "hi"
      },
      "index": 0,
      "relevance_score": -6.157620906829834
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 69,
    "total_tokens": 69
  }
}
```

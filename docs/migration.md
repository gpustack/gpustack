# Migration from v0.7 and Earlier

In v0.7 and earlier, GPUStack used an embedded SQLite database by default to store management data. Starting from v2.0.0, GPUStack dropped SQLite support and now uses an embedded PostgreSQL database by default for improved performance and scalability.

If you previously deployed GPUStack with the embedded SQLite database, follow the steps below to migrate your data to the new PostgreSQL-based format.

!!! warning

      **Backup First:** Before starting the migration, it’s strongly recommended to back up your database.

      For default installations on v0.7 or earlier, stop the GPUStack server and create a backup of the SQLite database file located inside the container at:

      ```
      /var/lib/gpustack/database.db
      ```

      If you are using an external database, please back it up according to the backup procedure for your specific database system.

## Migration Guide

!!! note

      Since v2.0.0, GPUStack supports Linux only. For other OS, move the data directory to a Linux system and run the migration.

### Step 1: Identify Your Legacy Data Directory

Locate the data directory used by your previous GPUStack installation. The default path is:

```
/var/lib/gpustack
```

For other installation methods, refer to this [link](faq.md/#where-are-gpustacks-data-stored) to locate the data directory.

In the following steps, this path is referenced as `${your-data-dir}`.

### Step 2: Migrate Using Docker

#### Server Migration (NVIDIA GPUs)

If you are using NVIDIA GPUs, run the following Docker command to start the migration. Replace ${your-data-dir} with your legacy data directory containing the original SQLite database and related files.

By mounting `${your-data-dir}` to `/var/lib/gpustack` and setting the environment variable `GPUSTACK_MIGRATION_DATA_DIR`, GPUStack to automatically migrate the SQLite data to the new embedded PostgreSQL database during startup.

```diff
sudo docker run -d --name gpustack-server \
      --restart=unless-stopped \
      --privileged \
      --network=host \
      --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
+     --env GPUSTACK_MIGRATION_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/gpustack \
+     --volume ${your-data-dir}:/var/lib/gpustack \
      --runtime nvidia \
      gpustack/gpustack
```

This command will launch the GPUStack server in Docker, preserving and migrating your existing data.

#### Worker Migration (NVIDIA GPUs)

For worker nodes, replace `${your-data-dir}` with the legacy worker data directory path. Use the following command:

```diff
sudo docker run -d --name gpustack-worker \
      --restart=unless-stopped \
      --privileged \
      --network=host \
      --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
+     --volume ${your-data-dir}:/var/lib/gpustack \
      --runtime nvidia \
      gpustack/gpustack \
      --server-url ${server-url} \
      --token ${token}
```

This will launch the GPUStack worker using your existing data and connect it to the specified server.

#### Other GPU Architectures

For architectures other than NVIDIA (e.g., AMD, Ascend), the migration process remains the same. To migrate on these platforms:

1. Get the installation commands, please refer to the commands in the [Installation Documentation](installation/requirements.md).

1. Update the installation commands by mounting your legacy data directory to `/var/lib/gpustack`.

1. (Server Only) Add the environment variable `GPUSTACK_MIGRATION_DATA_DIR` as shown in the NVIDIA examples, only the server needs to add this environment variable.

The Server and Worker migration commands can be used directly after applying these changes.

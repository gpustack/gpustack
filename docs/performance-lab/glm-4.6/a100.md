# Optimizing GLM-4.6/GLM-4.5 Throughput on NVIDIA A100 GPUs

## Conclusion

Recommended configuration for optimizing throughput of GLM-4.6 on A100 GPUs:

???+ tip "Serving Command"
    ```bash
    vllm serve zai-org/GLM-4.6-FP8 -tp 8
    ```

!!! note
    1. Our benchmark tests do not cover all possible optimization combinations. For example, we select the inference engine that performs best under its default configuration as the starting point for further tuning. This pruning approach yields a local optimum, which may not be the global optimum.
    2. There are other optimization methods that depend on specific user scenarios, including max batch size, schedule configuration, extended KV cache, CUDA graph, etc. The conclusions in this document can serve as a starting point for more targeted optimizations.
    3. The tests are conducted on specific hardware and software setups. Advances in the inference engine may lead to new conclusions.
    4. Although using quantization may impact accuracy. FP8 quantization can achieves less than 1% accuracy drop for most models. See the [evaluation results](https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim/blob/main/README_en.md#-benchmark) for more details. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use FP8 quantization for high-throughput serving scenarios.

## Optimization Objective

Achieve high throughput under high-concurrency request scenarios.

## Experimental Setup

### Model

zai-org/GLM-4.6

### Hardware

NVIDIA A100 GPUs

### Engine Version

- vLLM: v0.11.0
- SGLang: v0.5.3
- TensorRT-LLM: v1.0.0

### Benchmark Dataset

1. ShareGPT
2. Random dataset with varying sequence lengths:
    - Very long prompt: 32000 input tokens, 100 output tokens
    - Long prompt: 4000 input tokens, 200 output tokens
    - Medium prompt: 2000 input tokens, 100 output tokens
    - Short prompt: 128 input tokens, 4 output tokens

### Benchmark Script

We use the **vLLM bench CLI** tool to benchmark the model performance. The following command is used to run the benchmark:

```bash
# Prepare the ShareGPT dataset
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json

# Benchmark on ShareGPT dataset
vllm bench serve --model zai-org/GLM-4.6 --backend openai-chat --endpoint /v1/chat/completions --dataset-name sharegpt --dataset-path ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json --num-prompts 1000

# Benchmark on random dataset (fixed seed for reproducibility)
vllm bench serve --model zai-org/GLM-4.6 --backend openai-chat --endpoint /v1/chat/completions --dataset-name random --random-input-len 4000 --random-output-len 200 --num-prompts 500 --seed 42
```

## Experiment Results

The original BF16 precision model cannot be served on a single server with NVIDIA A100 GPUs due to memory limitations. Therefore, we focus on serving the FP8 quantization model.

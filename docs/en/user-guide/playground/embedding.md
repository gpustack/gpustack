# Embedding Playground

The Embedding Playground lets you test the modelâ€™s ability to convert text into embeddings. It allows you to experiment with multiple text inputs, visualize embeddings, and review code examples for API integration.

## Add Text

Add at least two text entries and click the `Submit` button to generate embeddings.

## Batch Input Text

Enable `Batch Input Mode` to automatically split multi-line text into separate entries based on line breaks. This is useful for processing multiple text snippets in a single operation.

## Visualization

Visualize the embedding results using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensions and display them on a 2D plot. Results can be viewed in two formats:

1. **Chart** - Display PCA results visually.
2. **JSON** - View raw embeddings in JSON format.

In the chart, the distance between points represents the similarity between corresponding texts. Closer points indicate higher similarity.

## Clear

Click the `Clear` button to reset text entries and clear the output.

## Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-right corner of the playground UI.

## View Code

After experimenting with the text inputs, click the `View Code` button to see how you can call the API with the same input. Code examples are provided in `curl`, `Python`, and `Node.js`.

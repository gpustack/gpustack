# Image Playground

The Image Playground is a dedicated space for testing and experimenting with GPUStackâ€™s image generation APIs. It allows users to interactively explore the capabilities of different models, customize parameters, and review code examples for seamless API integration.

## Generate Image

## Prompt

You can input or randomly generate a prompt, then click the Submit button to generate an image.

![here a image](../../assets/playground/create-image-01.png)

## Clear Prompt

Click the `Clear` button to reset the prompt and remove the generated image.

## Preview

Select the `Faster` option for the `Preview` parameter to see the image generation progress in real-time.

## Edit Image

Upload an image and highlight the areas you want to modify by painting over them. Then, enter a prompt and `submit`. If no areas are painted, the entire image will be modified.

## Save Mask

Click `Save Mask` to save the painted areas as a separate image.

## Download Image

Click `Download Image` to save the edited image.


## Preview

You can enable `Preview` while editing images to see the changes in real-time.


## Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-right corner of the playground UI.

## Customize Parameters

You can customize the image generation parameters by switching between two API styles:

1. **OpenAI-compatible mode**.
2. **Advanced mode**.

### Advanced Parameters



| Parameter         | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Counts`          | `1`        | Number of images to generate.                                                                                                                                       |
| `Size`            | `512x512`  | The size of the generated image in 'widthxheight' format.                                                                                                           |
| `Sample Method`   | `euler_a`  | The sampler algorithm for image generation. Options include 'euler_a', 'euler', 'heun', 'dpm2', 'dpm++2s_a', 'dpm++2m', 'dpm++2mv2', 'ipndm', 'ipndm_v', and 'lcm'. |
| `Schedule Method` | `discrete` | The noise scheduling method.                                                                                                                                        |
| `Sampling Steps`  | `10`       | The number of sampling steps to perform. Higher values may improve image quality at the cost of longer processing time.                                             |
| `Guidance`       | `3.5`      | The scale for classifier-free guidance. A higher value increases adherence to the prompt.                                                                           |
| `CFG Scale`      | `4.5`      | The scale for classifier-free guidance. A higher value increases adherence to the prompt.                                                                           |
| `Negative Prompt` | (empty)    | A negative prompt to specify what the image should avoid.                                                                                                           |
| `Preview`         | `Faster`   | Controls how the image generation process is displayed. Options include 'Faster', 'Normal', 'None'.                                                                                                    |
| `Seed`            | (empty)    | Random seed.                                                                                                                                                        |

!!! note

    The maximum image size is restricted by the model's deployment settings. See the diagram below:

## Prompts

You can adjust the prompt messages on the left side of the playground. There are three role types of prompt messages: system, user, and assistant.

- **System**: Typically a predefined instruction or guidance that sets the context, defines the behavior, or imposes specific constraints on how the model should generate its responses.
- **User**: The input or query provided by the user (the person interacting with the LLM).
- **Assistant**: The response generated by the LLM.

## Edit System Message

You can add and edit the system message at the top of the playground.

## Edit User and Assistant Messages

To add a user or assistant message, click the `New Message` button.

To remove a user or assistant message, click the minus button at the right corner of the message.

To change the role of a message, click the `User` or `Assistant` text at the beginning of the message.

# Chat Playground

Interact with the chat completions API. The following is an example screenshot:

![Playground Screenshot](../../assets/playground-screenshot.png)

## Prompts

You can adjust the prompt messages on the left side of the playground. There are three role types of prompt messages: system, user, and assistant.

- **System**: Typically a predefined instruction or guidance that sets the context, defines the behavior, or imposes specific constraints on how the model should generate its responses.
- **User**: The input or query provided by the user (the person interacting with the LLM).
- **Assistant**: The response generated by the LLM.

## Edit System Message

You can add and edit the system message at the top of the playground.

## Edit User and Assistant Messages

To add a user or assistant message, click the `New Message` button.

To remove a user or assistant message, click the minus button at the right corner of the message.

To change the role of a message, click the `User` or `Assistant` text at the beginning of the message.

## Upload Image

You can add images to the prompt by clicking the `Upload Image` button.

## Clear Prompts

Click the `Clear` button to clear all the prompts.

## Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-right corner of the playground. Please refer to [Model Management](./model-management.md) to learn about how to manage models.

## Customize Parameters

You can customize completion parameters in the `Parameters` section.

## Do Completion

You can do a completion by clicking the `Submit` button.

## View Code

Once you've done experimenting with the prompts and parameters, you can click the `View Code` button to check how you can call the API with the same input by code. Code examples in `curl`, `Python`, and `Node.js` are provided.

# Compare Playground

You can compare multiple models in the playground. The following is an example screenshot:

![Compare Playground Screenshot](../../assets/compare-playground-screenshot.png)

## Upload Image

You can add images to the prompt by clicking the `Upload Image` button.

## Clear Prompts

Click the `Clear` button to clear all the prompts.

## Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-left corner of each model panel.

## Customize Parameters

You can customize completion parameters by clicking the settings button of each model.

## Image Playground

You can test the model's image generation capabilities in this section.

### Prompt

You can input or randomly generate a prompt, then click the Submit button to generate an image.

![here a image](../assets/playground/image-prompt.png)

### Clear Prompt

Click the `Clear` button to reset the prompt and remove the generated image.

### Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-left corner of each model panel.

### Customize Parameters

You can customize the image generation parameters by switching between two styles:

1. **OpenAI-compatible mode**.
2. **Advanced mode**.

For details on advanced mode parameters, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/gpustack/llama-box)ã€‚

![image-parameter](../assets/playground/image-params.png)

!!! warning

    The maximum image size is restricted by the model's deployment settings. See the diagram below:

![image-size-setting](../assets/playground/image-size.png)

### View Code

Once you've done experimenting with the prompts and parameters, you can click the `View Code` button to check how you can call the API with the same input by code. Code examples in `curl`, `Python`, and `Node.js` are provided.

## Audio - Text to Speech

Switch to the top tab to test text-to-speech models.

### Text Input

Enter the text you want to convert, then click the `Submit` button to generate the corresponding speech.

![text-to-speech](../assets/playground/text-to-speech.png)

### Clear Text

Click the `Clear` button to reset the text input and remove the generated speech.

### Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-left corner of each model panel.

### Customize Parameters

Customize the voice and format of the audio output.

!!! warning
    
    Supported voices may vary between models.

### View Code

Once you've done experimenting with the input text and parameters, you can click the `View Code` button to check how you can call the API with the same input by code. Code examples in `curl`, `Python`, and `Node.js` are provided.

## Audio - Speech to Text

Switch to the "Audio - Speech to Text" tab to test speech-to-text models.

### Provide Audio File

You can provide the audio for conversion in two ways:

1. **Upload an audio file**.
2. **Record audio online**.

!!! warning
    If the online recording is not available, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

    1. For HTTPS or `http://localhost` access, microphone permissions must be enabled in your browser.  
    2. For access via `http://{host IP}`, the URL must be added to your browser's trusted list.  

          **Example:** In Chrome, go to `chrome://flags/`, add the GPUStack URL to "Insecure origins treated as secure," and enable this option.

### Select Model

You can select available models in GPUStack by clicking the model dropdown at the top-left corner of each model panel.


### Copy Text

Copy the generated transcription results.

### Customize Parameters

Select the appropriate language for your audio file.

### View Code

You can test the model's ability to transform text into embeddings in this section.

### Add Text

Add at least two text entries and click the `Submit` button.

### Batch Input Text

Enable `Batch Input Mode` to automatically split multi-line text into separate entries based on line breaks.

### Visualization

Visualize the embedding results using PCA to reduce dimensions and display them on a 2D plot. Results can be viewed in two ways:

1. **Chart** - Display PCA results.
2. **JSON** - View raw embeddings for copying.

In the chart, the distance between points represents the similarity between the corresponding texts. Closer points indicate higher similarity.

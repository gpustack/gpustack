# Inference Backends

GPUStack supports the following inference backends:

- [llama-box](#llama-box)
- [vLLM](#vllm)
- [vox-box](#vox-box)
- [Ascend MindIE](#ascend-mindie-experimental)

When users deploy a model, the backend is selected automatically based on the following criteria:

- If the model is a [GGUF](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md) model, `llama-box` is used.
- If the model is a known `Text-to-Speech` or `Speech-to-Text` model, `vox-box` is used.
- Otherwise, `vLLM` is used.

## llama-box

[llama-box](https://github.com/gpustack/llama-box) is a LM inference server based on [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) and [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp).

### Supported Platforms

The llama-box backend supports Linux, macOS and Windows (with CPU offloading only on Windows ARM architecture) platforms.

### Supported Models

- LLMs: For supported LLMs, refer to the llama.cpp [README](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp#description).
- Diffussion Models: Supported models are listed in this [Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/gpustack/image-672dafeb2fa0d02dbe2539a9) or this [ModelScope collection](https://modelscope.cn/collections/Image-fab3d241f8a641).
- Reranker Models: Supported models can be found in this [Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/gpustack/reranker-6721a234527f6fcd90deedc4) or this [ModelScope collection](https://modelscope.cn/collections/Reranker-7576210e79de4a).

### Supported Features

#### Allow CPU Offloading

After enabling CPU offloading, GPUStack prioritizes loading as many layers as possible onto the GPU to optimize performance. If GPU resources are limited, some layers will be offloaded to the CPU, with full CPU inference used only when no GPU is available.

#### Allow Distributed Inference Across Workers

Enable distributed inference across multiple workers. The primary Model Instance will communicate with backend instances on one or more others workers, offloading computation tasks to them.

#### Multimodal Language Models

Llama-box supports the following multimodal language models. When using a vision language model, image inputs are supported in the chat completion API.

- Qwen2-VL

!!! Note

    When deploying a vision language model, GPUStack downloads and uses the multimodal projector file with the pattern `*mmproj*.gguf` by default. If multiple files match the pattern, GPUStack selects the file with higher precision (e.g., `f32` over `f16`). If the default pattern does not match the projector file or you want to use a specific one, you can customize the multimodal projector file by setting the `--mmproj` parameter in the model configuration. You can specify the relative path to the projector file in the model source. This syntax acts as shorthand, and GPUStack will download the file from the source and normalize the path when using it.

### Parameters Reference

See the full list of supported parameters for llama-box [here](https://github.com/gpustack/llama-box#usage).

## vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient LLMs inference engine. It is a popular choice for running LLMs in production. vLLM seamlessly supports most state-of-the-art open-source models, including: Transformer-like LLMs (e.g., Llama), Mixture-of-Expert LLMs (e.g., Mixtral), Embedding Models (e.g. E5-Mistral), Multi-modal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA)

By default, GPUStack estimates the VRAM requirement for the model instance based on the model's metadata. You can customize the parameters to fit your needs. The following vLLM parameters might be useful:

- `--gpu-memory-utilization` (default: 0.9): The fraction of GPU memory to use for the model instance.
- `--max-model-len`: Model context length. For large-context models, GPUStack automatically sets this parameter to `8192` to simplify model deployment, especially in resource constrained environments. You can customize this parameter to fit your needs.
- `--tensor-parallel-size`: Number of tensor parallel replicas. By default, GPUStack sets this parameter given the GPU resources available and the estimation of the model's memory requirement. You can customize this parameter to fit your needs.

For more details, please refer to [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server.html#command-line-arguments-for-the-server).

### Supported Platforms

The vLLM backend works on AMD64 Linux.

!!! Note

    1. When users install GPUStack on amd64 Linux using the installation script, vLLM is automatically installed.
    2. When users deploy a model using the vLLM backend, GPUStack sets worker label selectors to `{"os": "linux", "arch": "amd64"}` by default to ensure the model instance is scheduled to proper workers. You can customize the worker label selectors in the model configuration.

### Supported Models

Please refer to the vLLM [documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/models/supported_models.html) for supported models.

### Supported Features

#### Multimodal Language Models

vLLM supports multimodal language models listed [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/models/supported_models.html#multimodal-language-models). When users deploy a vision language model using the vLLM backend, image inputs are supported in the chat completion API.

#### Distributed Inference Across Workers (Experimental)

vLLM supports distributed inference across multiple workers using [Ray](https://ray.io). You can enable a Ray cluster in GPUStack by using the `--enable-ray` start parameter, allowing vLLM to run distributed inference across multiple workers.

!!! warning "Known Limitations"

    1. The GPUStack server and all participating workers must run on Linux and use the same version of Python, which is a requirement of Ray.
    2. Model files must be accessible at the same path on all participating workers. You must either use a shared file system or download the model files to the same path on all participating workers.
    3. Each worker can only be assigned to one distributed vLLM model instance at a time.

Auto-scheduling is supported with the following conditions:

- Participating workers have the same number of GPUs.
- All GPUs in the worker satisfy the gpu_memory_utilization(defaults to 0.9) requirement.
- The total number of GPUs can be divided by the number of attention heads.
- The total VRAM claim is greater than the estimated VRAM claim.

If the above conditions are not met, the model instance will not be scheduled automatically. However, you can manually schedule it by selecting the desired workers/GPUs in the model configuration.

### Parameters Reference

See the full list of supported parameters for vLLM [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server.html#command-line-arguments-for-the-server).

## vox-box

[vox-box](https://github.com/gpustack/vox-box) is an inference engine designed for deploying text-to-speech and speech-to-text models. It also provides an API that is fully compatible with the OpenAI audio API.

### Supported Platforms

The vox-box backend supports Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

!!! note

    1. To use Nvidia GPUs, ensure the following NVIDIA libraries are installed on workers:
        - [cuBLAS for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)
        - [cuDNN 9 for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
    2. When users install GPUStack on Linux, macOS and Windows using the installation script, vox-box is automatically installed.
    3. CosyVoice models are natively supported on Linux AMD architecture and macOS. However, these models are not supported on Linux ARM or Windows architectures.

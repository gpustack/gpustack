- **Scales with Your GPU Inventory:** Easily add more GPUs or nodes to scale up your operations.
- **Lightweight Python Package:** Minimal dependencies and operational overhead.
- **OpenAI-compatible APIs:** Serve APIs that are compatible with OpenAI standards.
- **User and API key management:** Simplified management of users and API keys to enhance security.
- **GPU metrics monitoring:** Monitor GPU performance and utilization in real-time.
- **Token usage and rate metrics:** Track token usage and manage rate limits effectively.

## Installation

### Linux or MacOS

GPUStack provides a script to install it as a service on systemd or launchd based systems. To install GPUStack using this method, just run:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.gpustack.ai | sh -s -
```

Optionally, you can add extra workers to form a GPUStack cluster by running the following command on other nodes:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.gpustack.ai | sh -s - --server-url http://myserver --token mytoken
```

In the default setup, you can run the following to get the token used for adding workers:

```bash
cat /var/lib/gpustack/token
```

### Windows

Run PowerShell as administrator, then run the following command to install GPUStack:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://get.gpustack.ai" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

Optionally, you can add extra workers to form a GPUStack cluster by running the following command on other nodes:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression "& { $((Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://get.gpustack.ai" -UseBasicParsing).Content) } -ServerURL http://myserver -Token mytoken"
```

In the default setup, you can run the following to get the token used for adding workers:

```powershell
Get-Content -Path (Join-Path -Path $env:APPDATA -ChildPath "gpustack\token") -Raw
```

### Manual Installation

For manual installation or detail configurations, refer to the [installation](.docs/user-guide/installation.md) docs.

## Gettting Started

1. Run and chat with the llama3 model:

```bash
gpustack chat llama3 "tell me a joke."
```

2. Open `http://myserver` in the browser to access the GPUStack UI. Log in to GPUStack with username `admin` and the default password. You can run the following command to get the password for the default setup:

```bash
cat /var/lib/gpustack/initial_admin_password
```

3. Click `Playground` in the navigation menus. Now you can chat with the LLM in the UI playground.

4. Click `API Keys` in the navigation menus, then click the `New API Key` button.

5. Fill in the `Name` and click the `Save` button.

6. Copy the generated API key and save it somewhere safe. Please note that you can only see it once on creation.

7. Now you can use the API key to access the OpenAI-compatible API. For example, use curl as the following:

```bash
export GPUSTACK_API_KEY=myapikey
curl http://myserver/v1-openai/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GPUSTACK_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama3",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## Supported Platforms

## Supported Models

GPUStack uses [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) as the backend and supports large language models in [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md). Models from the following sources are supported:

1. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

2. [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library)

Here are some example models:

- [x] [LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama)
- [x] [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1)
- [x] [Mixtral MoE](https://huggingface.co/models?search=mistral-ai/Mixtral)
- [x] [DBRX](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct)
- [x] [Falcon](https://huggingface.co/models?search=tiiuae/falcon)
- [x] [Baichuan](https://huggingface.co/models?search=baichuan-inc/Baichuan)
- [x] [Aquila](https://huggingface.co/models?search=BAAI/Aquila)
- [x] [Yi](https://huggingface.co/models?search=01-ai/Yi)
- [x] [StableLM](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai)
- [x] [Deepseek](https://huggingface.co/models?search=deepseek-ai/deepseek)
- [x] [Qwen](https://huggingface.co/models?search=Qwen/Qwen)
- [x] [Phi](https://huggingface.co/models?search=microsoft/phi)
- [x] [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/gemma)
- [x] [Mamba](https://huggingface.co/models?search=state-spaces/mamba)
- [x] [Grok-1](https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-1)

## OpenAI-Compatible APIs

GPUStack serves the following OpenAI compatible APIs under the `/v1-openai` path:

1. List models
2. Chat completions

For example, you can use the official [OpenAI Python API library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) to consume the APIs:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://myserver/v1-openai", api_key="myapikey")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="llama3",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

GPUStack users can generate their own API keys in the UI.

## Build

1. Install `python 3.10+`.

2. Run `make build`.

You can find the built wheel package in `dist` directory.
